Alert COVID-19 is a small multiplatform tool written in Golang to help keep you informed about the current situation of COVID-19 in your region,
while you stay safe at home.

At every hour, it fetches data from an API and displays a native notification on your system if there's any updates
on the number of confirmed cases, deaths or recovered patients.

## Getting started

If you just want to get up and running, follow these steps:

1. Go to the [release page](https://github.com/renanbastos93/alertcovid19/releases)
2. Download the lastest release for your platform (MacOS, Linux or Windows)
3. Extract the contents and run the executable file

### Building the project

If you want to build the project yourself, here's how you can use our Makefile:

```bash
# Build the project
$ make <macos|linux|windows>

# Run the program, updating every 10s and if there's a changes, display a notification
# Defaults to 1h00m00s (1 hour)
$ ./alertcovid19 -t 10s

# If you want to remove the built files
$ make clean

# Or simply...
$ go run .
```
